This project was made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Major To Do List:
<br />

<ol>
  <br/>
  <li>Reformat the harmful additive data so there is a way to easily compare user's search to my data</li>
  <li>Refractor Serach Results to be a component and each individual result its own component</li>
  <strike><li> Refractor the Python script that generates the JSON file to save the JSON object to a .ts file automatically</li></strike>
  <li> <strong> Only do this when code is ready to be deployed: </strong> Use Material Ui's styling to make it look nice </li>
</ol>
